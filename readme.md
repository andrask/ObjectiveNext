These were some ideas I had for a replacement Objective C language, around January 2013.

It's easy to get excited about the (non-existing) language if you're an Objective C programmer, but I'm imploring you to try and think beyond a "new old-thing", try to actually think of something that's really better.

We could definitely build the Objective Next language I've (partially) described here, and it *would* be nicer than Objective C today, but it ultimately wouldn't allow us to create better software, and it wouldn't let us create in a better way, either.
